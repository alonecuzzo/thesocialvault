Pro's & Con's


 =================
1. Tumblr-site
    Pro's
    1. Feed.  I like that there is just a list of items that seems to go on forever, mostly images.
    2. I like liking stuff.
    3. I like the actual images that I see.
    4. I love forever scroll.
    5. I like the quick scroll to the top.
    6. I like seeing the names of other people that post things that I'm interested in.
    7. I like the tags and being able to save tags for later to filter my feed.
    8. The best part is loosing track of time while liking stuff.
    9. I like being able to filter posts by my posts so that I can see what others have said/commented or who started following me.
    
    Con's
    1. I hate that I can't sort my list of linked items
    2. The like button is too small, and shoved in too closely between other buttons.
    3. The 'link-to' button isn't obvious.  The functionality isn't.
    4. When a new post in my feed is updated, it should fade in, instead of showing a number.
    5. The ability to post-nav looks a little consumed by the feed.
    6. The directory feels weird to me... Not sure why yet.
    7. Goodies tab is pretty dumb.
 
 
=================   
2. Facebook-site
    Pro's
    1. I like clicking on shit and being instantly brought to a person's site, or going to see that picture.
    2. I love seeing when I have notifications.
    3. The Home-Profile-Acct nav at the top-right.  It's minimal.
    4. I like the picture reordering now found in albums.
    5. I like that clicking takes me through photos.
    
    Con's
    1. Emails from facebook... Of any kind. 
    2. The side bars are redundant and they clutter the interface.
    3. I don't like the feed.  The different types of media, make it look too incosistent.  I like how on Flipboard you get variation but in a more consistent way.
    4. I hate that my recent activity is posted on my wall.
    5. I don't really like receiving public messages, especially if I'm ignoring someone.
    6. I just think that a lot of the information is too public.
    7. I hate that "most recent" button.  Why wouldn't I want the most recent updates in my feed?
    8. I don't like using the messages, mostly because I'm always getting spammed.
    9. **I wish that I could create a custom feed; of only updates from people that I choose.
    10. I hate that the notifications, the evidence of interaction is what really makes me addicted.


 =================
3. Twitter-site
    Pro's
    1. Infinite scroll.
    2. Lack of clutter.
    3. When you click on a post; I like the video/image etc. drawer that slides out.
    4. I like the "who you should follow" suggestions.
    5. I like that my stats are easily accessible.  I like that there's a measure or @ least a sense of measure of my interaction.  What would it look like if this
        measure was compared to others as easily?  Like, "how does my interaction rate compare to my friends'?"
    6. I like seeing the most recent trends as well.
    
    Cons's
    1. There should be a notification badge that updates whenever you have a new message, RT, or a response.
    2. You can't schedule tweets.


 =================
4. Foursquare- site
    Pro's
    1. I like the animations.  When ignoring or recieving a request etc.
    2. I like that you can see a history of your activity.
    3. **I love the badges.  A good way to encourage participation.  Somewhere near should be the badges of your friends.
    4. I love that they have a stats tab.
    
    Con's
    1. The stats page is kind of confusing layout-wise.  
    2. Should be able to see friends' points or rating or number of badges or something like that.


 =================
5. Hootsuite-site    
    Pro's
    1. Can schedule tweets.
    2. Kind of like how it feels like a desktop app with the menus/navigation.
    
    Con's
    1. A lot of the functionality seems hidden or buried in weird places.  Deep within the menu system.
    2. The menu should be more obvious, like a microsoft word.  The Owl doesn't exactly scream "click on me to see more options!".
    3. Hate the grey buttons etc.... I hate mostly how this site looks actually now that I think about it.  The scheduling is the only real good part; and maybe seeing your stats/ analytics.
