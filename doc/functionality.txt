Functionality list:  Basically a list of missing functionality or functionality in existing site's apps that we should consider incorporating.

1. Queueing posts: People can post while still offline, all queued posts will be posted once the user signs back on.  Similar to git.
2. Rating system: Some sort of system that gives users points or followers.  Not sure how that will work exactly, but it should be something that adds to the user's vanity.  Maybe 
    the more they use the app, or the more that they interact with it, the more points they get or something.  Or maybe there's a likeability rating.
3. In-app buys: I have no idea at this moment what we could sell.
4. Ability to customize or filter feed, by type of post, SN, etc.
5. Infinite scroll~ find a way around ipad's picture memory limitation...

6. Have a barcode or something on the person's cover page.  The cover page exists at the top of the feed, and might have a random photo from the person's profile.


*social media sites are like items in a person's wardrobe.  They should be able to mix and match them in a way that they find satisfying.
